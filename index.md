### Workflow process


### Projects at [3CSharedServices](https://www.3csharedservices.org/) 

#### Umbraco websites
[South Cambridgeshire Distric Council](https://www.scambs.gov.uk/)
[Huntingdonshire District Council](https://www.huntingdonshire.gov.uk/)
[Cambridge City Council](https://www.cambridge.gov.uk/)

#### MVC projects
Most MVC projects handled at work were created by other people. My responsibilities were mostly bugfixing or updating the existing projects.
- Bin Calendar projects - used to display the refuse collections for three council districs areas.
- Shopmobility  more about it here: https://www.huntingdonfirst.co.uk/business/hunts-shopmobility and https://www.huntingdonshire.gov.uk/people-communities/shopmobility-scheme/ 

#### PowerShell solutions
- In house scripts that allow for faster set up of existing projects. Used in conjunction with the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/) or [Az Copy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-ref-azcopy-copy) for easy blob storage access.
- In house scripts that call external trusted APIs in order to save data locally.
- In house scripts that run inside a dedicated server as a task and update the SSL certificates of the websites using [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) portal for certificate generation.

## Skills

### C#
Csharp is my go to language of choice when it comes to programming. It was not the first language that I've learned but it is the one I like the most and feel most confidend in using when creating new projects.
I use it at work and in my personal projects.
I've worked on projects written in .NET framework and in .NET Core.

### [Linq](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/linq/what-is-linq)
Linq is the most common tool used when working with data in .NET. I use it frequently and feel confident in using it. 

### [Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview)


### [Application Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview)

### [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview)

### [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)

### [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

### [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
I've had pleasure workin with this library. Nowdays JavaScript had most of the features present here covered. At [3CSharedServices](https://www.3csharedservices.org/) we used it to cover backwards compatibility with the old IE.

### [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)
Basic knowledge used to extend umbraco backoffice components (editor tools).

### [Angular](https://angular.io/)
Basic knowledge used in my spare time to investigate the framework.

### [React](https://reactjs.org/)
I've spent quite a bit of time learning and testing [React](https://reactjs.org/). I created a few projects to learn and understand how it works. I've learned how to use it with TypeScript. 

The first project that introduced me to React is called [String-Manipulator](https://mattomwit.github.io/string-manipulator/). I use it ever since. It allows to store multiple string manipulation actions and save them in a reusable list. In case I need to repeat the process later on. I use it usually when creating git branches by using commands like `To Lowercase`, `Replace " " with -` and `prepend /feature`.

After that I played around with Next.js to generate static page application. I also tried to see how to use the Material UI. 

At work:
- Created a proof of concept [DevOps extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/marketplace/overview) by adding a new section to DevOps portal. 
- Used an SDK provided by microsoft ([azure-devops-extension-sdk](https://github.com/microsoft/azure-devops-extension-sdk)) in order to authenticate users before they could view the content of the extension.
- Used [azure-devops-ui](https://developer.microsoft.com/pl-pl/azure-devops/) to keep the style of the extension consistant with the existing portal UI design.

### [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
Used extensively at work.
- [merge](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge) - This is probably the most common use for every developer. I frequently had to merge my changes with branches from other developers. These sometimes cause conflicts which have to be resolved. 
- [blame](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame) - Frequently used when fixing issues. I use it to figure out when the changes were made and what did the code look like before.  
- [cherry-pick](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-cherry-pick) - Used when I need changes from other branch which is still in progress or when I need to test a feature in isolation. 
- [bisect](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect) - This is my favorite git command by far. It allows the user to find which commit introduced a bug. This can be really useful when trying to remove an issue or check what is causing it.

Flowchart Maker & Online Diagram Software. 
It is very useful when designing architecture or in my case to draw existing one by analyzing the existing code and integrations.

### Visual Studio
This is my favorite IDE. It can do a lot of things and when utilized well replaces many external tools. 
Some features I like to use are `Git`, `Cloud Explorer`, `Server Explorer` and [Application Insights Search](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/diagnostic-search)
